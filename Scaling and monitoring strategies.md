# Production and monitoring strategies

### Strategy for scaling the solution to millions of feature update events

#### Data Ingestion: Kinesis Data Streams

- Real-time processing
- Maintains the events' order
- Auto-scaling
- Configure retry policies

#### Processing: AWS Lambda or ECS/EKS for stream processing

- Process each incoming event 
- Use ECS/EKS for more complex processing

#### Update feature values: SQS buffer layer before the feature store (decoupling)

- SQS queues as write buffer
- Group multiple feature updates into batches

#### Caching: Amazon ElastiCache

- Cache frequently accessed features

#### Auto-scaling

- Feature store: scale based on read/write throughput and storage metrics

### Strategy for production deployment and monitoring

#### Implement a CI/CD pipeline: 

- Multi-environment: dev - stag - prod

- Implement blue-green deployment (ensure zero down time)

#### Feature store monitoring

- Track feature freshness: monitor difference in time between event occurrence and feature updates

- Monitor storage utilization.

- Set up auto-scaling triggers

- Implement data quality check

#### Cost Monitoring

- Budget alerts

#### Logging and Tracing

- Centralized Logging with log retention policies (CloudWatch and CloudTrail)

#### Alerts

- Feature store unavailability
- Event processing pipeline failures
- Increased event loss rate
- Storage utilization approaching limits
- Cost anomalies

#### Backups

- Regular snapshots of offline store

#### Access Control

- Least privilege access
- Regular IAM audit procedures
